# Comp110 Curriculum

Here is the basic breakdown of concepts covered in this class. We know Unit 0 seems long and daunting, and that's because this class can have a steep learning curve! But these concepts are more straightforward and less complicated than those in the later units, and we will spend ample time on them!

## Unit 0 - The basics
- The basics of VS Code and running a Python program
- Objects and Data Types
   - Basic types (int, float, str, bool)
- Commenting and Doc Strings
- Expressions
   - Evaluating Expressions
   - Order of Operations
   - What *type* expressions evaluate to
- Variables and User Input
   - Syntax for initializing a variable and assigning it a value
   - Syntax for updating a variable's value
   - Using the `input()` function to prompt for and receive user input

## Unit 1 - Conditionals, Booleans, and Memory Diagrams
- Conditionals
   - Syntax of an if block
   - Syntax of an if...else block
- Booleans
    - Evaluating Boolean Expressions
    - How `not`, `and`, `or` work
    - Order of Operations
    - Using boolean expressions in a conditional
- Memory Diagrams
   - Establishing a stack and an output box
   - Diagramming basic variable assignments and updates
   - Diagramming Conditionals

## Unit 2 - While loops + some useful tools

- While Loops
  - Syntax of a while loop
  - Idea of indexing
  - While loops in memory diagrams
- Counters
    - How to create and use a variable as a counter
- Relative Reassignment Operators
   - Functionality of relative reassignment operators
-  Unicode, Emoji, Escape Sequences, and f-Strings
   -  String Escape sequences
   -  F-strings: how to write them in code and evaluate them when printed

## Unit 3 - Functions

- Functions
  -  Calling functions
   -  Importing functions
   -  Returning vs Printing
- Function Syntax
   -  Syntax for defining a function
   -  Syntax for calling a function
   -  The similarities and differences of signatures and function calls (including parameters vs. arguments)
  -  Calling functions within functions
- Function Semantics
   -  Memory Diagram representation of function definitions and calls
      -  Function frames
      -  Function call steps
      - Heap storage
      - Return Address and Values
- Scope
   - Applying scope to memory diagrams in terms of function call frames
- Importing Modules
   - Knowing basic import syntax: `from <package-name> import <module-name>` and `from <package-name>.<module-name> import <function>`
   - Knowing how to handle `if __name__ == "__main__":` in a memory diagram

## Unit 4: 'for' loops, Lists, Dictionaries, and Unit Tests
- Lists
   - Basic list syntax and typing
   - Indexing on lists and updating values at an index (subscription notation)
   - `len()` function
   - methods: `.append()` and `.pop()`
- Lists in Memory
   - Memory Diagrams with lists
   - Writing functions with lists (both modifying existing lists or creating new lists)
- for loops
   - Using `for ... in ...` syntax in memory diagrams and writing functions
   - Using `for ... in range(...)` syntax in memory diagrams and writing functions
- Dictionaries
   - Basic list syntax and typing
   - Accessing, adding, and modifying values at an index (subscription notation)
   - function: `len()`
   - method: `.pop()`
   - using the boolean expression: `elem in dictionary`
   - Memory Diagrams with dictionaries
   - Using a for loop to iterate through a dictionary's keys
- Unit Tests


## Unit 5 - Algorithms and Runtime Analysis

## Unit 6 - Recursion

## Unit 7 - Object Oriented Programming
- Syntax for defining a Class and its methods
    - Creating a `Class`
    - Listing attributes and their types
    - Defining a constructor method (`__init__`)
    - Defining a method within the class
- Syntax for instantiating a Class and calling methods
    - Importing a `Class` and calling its constructor
    - Calling methods on an object of a defined `Class`
    - Accessing attributes of an object of a `Class` (e.g. `my_pizza.toppings`)
- Classes in Memory
   - Memory diagram for a Class definition and instantiation (Hint: Try making a step-by-step procedure as outlined [here](https://campuswire.com/c/GD77C6F5C/feed/457).)

## Unit 8 - Advanced Object Oriented Programming
- Magic Methods
   - Syntax for defining and calling a magic method
   - Writing a `__str__` magic method
   - Diagramming a `__str__` magic method
- Operator Overloads
   - Syntax for defining and calling a magic method that overloads operators
   - Writing and Diagramming both `__add__` and `__mul__` magic methods
