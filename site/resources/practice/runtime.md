# Questions

## Conceptual

1. True or False: A function with a big-O notation of $O(n)$ will always run faster than a function with a big-O notation of $O(n^2)$ for all inputs.
<details>
<summary>SHOW SOLUTIONS</summary>
This is False. A function with big-O notation of $O(n)$ will theoretically run faster than a function with a big-O notation of $O(n^2)$ on a *worst case* input.
</details>

2. What type of input does Big-O notation consider?
3. Big-O notation provides a precise measurement of the actual runtime of an algorithm on a specific machine.
4. If an algorithm has a time complexity of $O(1)$, it means its runtime is:
5. If an algorithm has a time complexity of$ O(n)$, it means its runtime is:
6. If an algorithm has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$, it means its runtime is:
7. If an algorithm has a time complexity of $O(2^n)$, it means its runtime is:
8. Insertion sort has a big-O runtime of:
9. Selection sort has a big-O runtime of:
