# Questions

## Conceptual

1. True or False: A function with a big-O notation of $O(n)$ will always run faster than a function with a big-O notation of $O(n^2)$ for all inputs.
<details>
<summary>SOLUTION</summary>
This is False. A function with big-O notation of $O(n)$ will theoretically run faster than a function with a big-O notation of $O(n^2)$ on a *worst case* input.
</details>

2. What type of input does Big-O notation consider?
<details>
<summary>SOLUTION</summary>
Worst Case.
</details>

3. Big-O notation provides a precise measurement of the actual runtime of an algorithm on a specific machine.
<details>
<summary>SOLUTION</summary>
False.
</details>

4. If an algorithm has a time complexity of $O(1)$, it means its runtime is:
<details>
<summary>SOLUTION</summary>
Constant
</details>

5. If an algorithm has a time complexity of$ O(n)$, it means its runtime is:
<details>
<summary>SOLUTION</summary>
Linear
</details>

6. If an algorithm has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$, it means its runtime is:
<details>
<summary>SOLUTION</summary>
Quadratic
</details>

7. If an algorithm has a time complexity of $O(2^n)$, it means its runtime is:
<details>
<summary>SOLUTION</summary>
Exponential
</details>

8. Insertion sort has a big-O runtime of:
<details>
<summary>SOLUTION</summary>
$O(n)$
</details>

9. Selection sort has a big-O runtime of:
<details>
<summary>SOLUTION</summary>
$O(n)$
