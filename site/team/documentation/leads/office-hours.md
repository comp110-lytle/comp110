### Kaleb White

Graduation Year: 2025

Why I <3 Team 110: I must keep the family legacy going. The site is plagued with the name Ezri White. Now it will be stamped with the name Kaleb White.

Fun Fact: I recently paid $420 dollars to the university for parking tickets because they sent it to collections on my sister. My relationship with my parents will never be the same, nor will my sister's relation with her credit score.
