## General Purpose of Role:

Ensure office hours operate smoothly and maintain a high quality of service for our students.

## Before your shift:

Check Homebase and verify you are the Shift Lead before your shift starts. As people swap in and out of shifts someone may have superseded you as the Shift Lead.

## At the beginning of your shift:

- It is imperative as the Shift Lead you arrive **on time** if not a minute or two early.
- Check in with the Shift Lead for the previous hour to see if there are common student issues or any other topics that need to be addressed.
- Look around office hours and compare who is there with who is on the schedule. If it is 5 minutes past the hour, message any missing TAs on Slack to check-in. In cases of extreme lateness, try to encourage the TA to stay after their shift to make up the missed time.

## During your shift:

If there is no queue in office hours, let others call tickets and remain available as a “floater”. TAs can come to you if they run into technical problems they get stuck on. Keep an eye on the general flow of office hours and have a sense of what are the common problems students come in with.

You should not hover over team members’ shoulders unless asked for help or mentorship directly.

### When office hours are slow:

- Ensure tickets are being distributed equally across the TAs as they come into the queue. There should not be a single TA calling all of the tickets.
- Walk around and chat with the other TAs. Use this as a time to get to know the team and provide mentorship (check in on how things are going, give advice on classes, etc.).

### When office hours are busy:

- **Do** call tickets! However, after you close a ticket, size up the current status of office hours and the queue. Perhaps take a quick stroll around the room and see if anyone grabs you in need of help.
- Keep an eye on how long fellow team members are spending with students when there is a queue. Keep an eye on appointments > 15 minutes and, if necessary, step in to help bring it to a close.

## At the end of your shift:

- Fill out the following form at the end of each hour to record any concerns encountered during your shift: [Shift Lead Form](https://forms.gle/aUGtnnx8AGHcGEuE7)
- Bring any recurring problems to the attention of the next Shift Lead!

Note: We are currently only filling out the shift lead form if an abnormality in OH happens.
