## Why Computer Science
I took COMP 110 summer before starting my first semester at UNC. Taking this class demystified many ideas that I had about computer science. CS challenges me to become a more logical and scientific thinker because I can never get lazy and solely “expect” something to work without a clear goal & step by step process on how to achieve it. 

## Favorite Programming Keyword
Let. Since x, y, z get all the spotlights outside the realm of programming, the CS community decided to give attention to this random letter “i.” “Let i” be this, “let i” be that, it’s amazing.
