For this course, your laptop **must meet** the <a href="https://cci.unc.edu/new-students/minimum-laptop-requirement/" target="_blank">Carolina Computing Initiative</a> standards.

Additionally, your operating system must be up-to-date. This is a best practice to ensure you not only have the latest security updates, but also the latest software development features which are packaged along with them.

## Windows 10 / 11

Check your Windows version number before continuing:

Press `Windows Button + R`, type `winver`, and press `Ok` or `Enter`.

Windows 10: Be sure you have AT LEAST version 21H2 (build 19044 or higher), but we recommend updating to 22H2 (build 19045 or higher). If your installed version of Windows is not up-to-date, visit the following URL and look for the Windows 10 May 2020 Update area. Follow the steps needed to upgrade your operating system: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank">https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10</a>

Windows 11: Be sure you have at least 21H2. If your installed version of Windows is not up-to-date, visit the following URL and look for the Windows 10 May 2020 Update area. Follow the steps needed to upgrade your operating system: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11" target="_blank">https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11</a>

Once your Windows Operating System is up-to-date, continue to the next step: [Install Required Software](/resources/setup/software.html)

## macOS

Open Spotlight Search (the magnifying glass icon in the top-right corner), search for: _About this Mac_.

If your operating system version is not 13.0 or greater, look for a _Software Update..._ button or _More Info..._ button, and follow instructions to install the recommended updates for your macOS operating system.
