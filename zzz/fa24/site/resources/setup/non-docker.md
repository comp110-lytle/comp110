## When Software Setup or Computers Fail...

If you have tried setting up your workspace using docker, and are having issues (or if you just want to be able to use your workspace without docker), there are two options!

1. You can run everything you need in your web browser via Github Codespaces! The instructions to that can be found [here](/resources/setup/codespaces.html).

2. You can set up a workspace on your computer that doesn't use docker. (Unfortunately, this means you will not be able to use the trailhead.)
The instructions to that can be found [here](/resources/setup/non-docker-setup.html).
