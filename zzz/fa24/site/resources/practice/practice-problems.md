# Practice Problems

The following questions will help solidify concepts learned in class as well as prepare you for the quizzes and final!

The quiz itself will be similar in difficulty to these practice questions. In addition to these questions, you should review all of your lesson responses on Gradescope. The kinds of questions you responded to on Gradescope could also be on the exams.

It is also recommended to complete the [practice memory diagrams](/resources/practice/MemDiagrams.html).

If you ever find yourself feeling really lost, feel free to take these questions to [office hours](/support) or get more extended help in [tutoring](/support)!
