# Snippet

<pre>
<code class="python">    def f(x: str) -> int:
        return len(x) + 1


    def g(x: int, y: str) -> int:
        while x > len(y):
            x -= 1
        return x


    def main() -> None:
        (g(f("python"), "java"))


    main()

*Image Description* 

The Memory Diagram includes three columns titled Stack, Heap, and Output. 

The Stack includes 4 frames in the following order from top to bottom including Globals, main, f, and g. 

The Globals frame has 3 variables including f, g, and main. 

*  f has id 0, it is a function on the Heap (lines 1-2). 
*  g has id 1, it is a function on the Heap (lines 5-8). 
*  main has id 2, it is a function on the Heap (lines 11-12).  

The main frame has 2 items including the RA and RV. 

*  The RA is defined at line 15. 
*  The RV is None. 

The f frame has 3 items including the RA and RV and a variable named x. 

*  The RA is defined at line 12. 
*  The RV is 7. 
*  x is “python” 

The g frame has 4 items including the RA and RV and two variables named x and y. 

*  The RA is defined at line 12. 
*  The RV is 4 
*  x is 4 

*  Previous values of x include 7, 6, and 5 which are now crossed out *  y is “java” 
The Heap includes 3 function objects. 
Output is empty.
