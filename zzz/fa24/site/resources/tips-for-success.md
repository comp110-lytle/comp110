> Learning computer science can be both extremely gratifying and frustrating. This course will not only introduce you to new topics, but it will also introduce you to new ways of thinking. Forming good study habits early is incredibly important in this course as most concepts build upon each other. We have compiled a list of ‘Tips and Tricks’ to help you succeed and get the most out of the course. **Remember, the COMP 110 team is rooting for you!**

### In Class

- Have a blank page pulled up and write down any questions you have about the lecture. You can ask after class or in tutoring.
- Try to follow along with the coding examples as much as possible.

### Time Management

- Check the <a href="/" target="_blank">Comp110 Itinerary</a> for upcoming assignments/deadlines.
- Block 2 or 3 hours (in small chunks) in your calendars per week to work on assignments/course concepts.
- If you are struggling with a topic, **do not** wait until a quiz to get help.
- Attend tutoring/office hours early to avoid long wait times.
