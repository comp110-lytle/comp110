# Dropping and Swapping Shifts 

Here are some guidelines for dropping and swapping office hour shifts!

## Dropping a Shift

Occassionally, you'll be told that certain tasks are worthy of an amount of "shift drop"s. This means in exchange for this task, you can drop a certain amount office hours! (If you are unsure if your task qualifies, ask a team lead or the instructor!)

To document your shift drop, please go to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19uTJB6M2QNtU70TMxiw6tI8lxZm_4LB52XpGOWNg9l0/edit?usp=sharing) and add a column to the "Drop Application". Your office hours lead will review your request and update the "Number of Drops" sheet with the amount of shifts you are free to drop. (If it's been a while and your request hasn't been reviewed, reach out to your [office hours lead](/team/documentation/leads/office-hours.html).)

To request to use one of these drops to drop a specific shift, use the `#drop-requests` channel on the Slack!

## Swapping a Shift

If you have a less-than-ideal office hours shift, you have two options: you can swap shifts with a team member or you can swap it with an already open shift.

### Swapping with a Team Member

Post in the `#shift-swap` Slack channel to see if anyone is interested in trading shifts with you. If anyone volunteers, you can go ahead and swap those shifts on homebase!

### Picking up an Open Shift

Occassionally, you'll see some shifts on Homebase that are open. You can request to swap those shifts with your shift by posting in the `#open-shift-swap` channel. **Do NOT pick up the open shift on Homebase until you have your Office Hour Lead's approval!**
