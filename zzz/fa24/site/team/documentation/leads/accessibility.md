### AJ Valentino

Graduation Year: 2025

Semesters on Team 110: 4

Why I <3 Team 110: I first decided I wanted to join Team 110 after going to Hack 110 where I met and made friends with a couple of TAs. Since then not only have I made a lot of new TA friends, I've also gotten to meet many wonderful students and watch them slowly begin to understand the world of computer science.

Fun Fact: I'm scuba diving certified!

## Goals

My goals are to:
- Make the COMP 110 website as screen-readable as possible
- Add captions to all video lessons
- Add an accessibility section to the website
- Address any other accessibility needs that arise
