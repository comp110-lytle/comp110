This view contains all experiences people have had with companies or institutions. If someone is willing to be contacted about an experience, there will be a green check mark in the 'Contact Me!' column, and the same entry will appear in the 'Contactable Experiences' view along with contact information. To view this data in a separate window, select 'View larger version' at the bottom of the data frame.
