# Office Hours 

Come drop-in for one-on-one support in office hours with a member of the [COMP110 team](/resources/team.html). Except for on due dates, the average wait time is typically less than five minutes.

Office hours is the ideal place to come for one-on-one help with:

* Exercises
* Conceptual Questions
* Lessons
* Challenge Questions

Typical office hours are listed to the right, but check Course.Care for the most up-to-date availability this week.

Note: We must stop taking tickets at the closing time and cannot stay beyond. If the queue is long enough that we do not believe we will be able to see all tickets we will turn off the ability to submit new tickets before closing time.

Office hours appointments for programming exercises are limited to 15 minutes and **one specific question** per appointment in order to be as fair as possible to all students enrolled. For longer, conceptual help outside of specific projects we encourage coming to office hours for conceptual help on non-deadline days.

In order to serve every student in the course as best we can, we must enforce a 1-hour wait period between appointments with the same student. During this time, we expect you to continue making substantive progress on your programming exercise. If you anticipate needing significant amounts of help on an assignment, please start as far in advance as possible so you will have multiple opportunities to ask questions as they arise. Realizing you need help more than once in a given day is an indication you would benefit from a stronger conceptual understanding of the material in question and it would be great for you to come work with us during tutoring hours!

To work with us in office hours, <a href="https://course.care/register-details?enrollCode=4B7EBD" target="_blank">register for Course.Care via this link</a> or register with enroll code 4B7EBD.


## Office Hours
To participate in in-person office hours:

1. Come to the lower-level lobby in Sitterson Hall
2. Please do not make a ticket until you are in the lobby area of Sitterson Hall hours and ready to work with a TA.
3. <a href="https://course.care/ng/course/107" target="_blank">Open Course.Care click "Check-in" for currently open office hours</a>. Select what kind of help you are seeking. Be detailed and descriptive in your request for help. If you fail to make an honest effort to describe the purpose of the meeting, TAs are instructed to cancel your request.
4. Wait in the lobby area until course.care says a TA is ready to work with you and then head into SN008.
5. Our teaching team will get to you as soon as we can! When your ticket is called, please come in to Sitterson 008.
6. After the 15-minute walk-in appointment concludes, return back to the lobby to continue working.


## Tutoring

<a href="https://course.care/ng/course/107" target="_blank">Come to tutoring hours for conceptual help</a> with members of the COMP110 UTA team and small groups of your peers. You can find these locations and links on <a href="https://course.care/ng/course/107" target="_blank">Course.Care</a>, just like office hours. If you are feeling a little behind or like you could use some extra practice tutoring is for you! Tutoring does not have time constraints outside of the hours it is open for.

Tutoring is a great opportunity to find help with:

* Conceptual Questions
* Lecture Review
* Practice

# EdStem

We're using [Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/us/join/nWVCDK) for class Q&A.

This is the best place to ask questions about the course, whether curricular or administrative. You will get faster answers here from staff and peers than through email.

Here are some tips:

* Search before you post
* Heart questions and answers you find useful
* Answer questions you feel confident answering (I keep an eye on this to inform who would make a good TA in the future!)
* Share interesting course related content with staff and peers
* Post logistical questions about the course under "Logistical Questions"
* Post conceptual questions about topics covered under "Conceptual Questions"
* Post assignment-specific questions under "Assignment Help". **MAKE THIS POST PRIVATE IF YOU ARE SHARING CODE OR ANSWERS.** We are only able to help with short questions online. If you have a longer form question, you will likely be redirected to office hours. *Please remember that your emergencies are not our emergencies!* In other words, it is not up to the TAs to answer a question hours/minutes before a deadline. Please start assignments as early as possible so you have time to get help in office hours!

Finally, though you can post anonymously, the 110 team is still able to see who posted what, so please keep that in mind! 

# Email

In general, we cannot help with programming or assignment questions via e-mail and you should come see us in office hours for questions on assignments. Over the years we have learned is too difficult, time consuming, and frustrating for you and for us to try and resolve technical issues via screenshots e-mailed back and forth. Thus, we will redirect any such emails to office hours (described above) and cannot help with technical issues over e-mail.

# Feedback

If you have suggestions on how to improve the course or just want to leave some positive, encouraging feedback for the TAs or Alyssa, please give us feedback! If you make a suggestion we’re able to act on while we still have time to, we’re more than happy to!
