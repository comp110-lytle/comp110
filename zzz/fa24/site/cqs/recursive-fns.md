# Writing a Recursive Function

For this challenge question, we are going to get more practice starting with a *standard* function definition and redefining it as a *recursive* python function.

<!-- This is exactly what we did in the [virtual lesson](https://comp110-24s.github.io/virtual-classes/VL08.html)! -->

## Standard Function Definition

The function we will be defining recursively is:

$f(n, k) = n \times k$, with recursion on $n \geq 0$.

This is how the *standard function* will look as a Python function:

```
    def f(n: int, k: int) -> int:
        return n * k
```

## Recursive Definition

We want to convert it into a *recursive function* that looks something like this:

```
    def f(n: int, k: int) -> int:
        if n == 0: #base case
            # <Put something here>
        else: # recursive rule
            # <Put something here>
```

You can do this by following the steps we took in class.

Looking at the standard function definition, fill in the sequence:

You can find the recursive rule by observing how you get from one output to another. 

For example, if I want to know the pattern for getting from $f(n-1,k)$ to $f(n,k)$, I could ask "How do I get from $f(2,k)$ to $f(3,k)$? How do I get from $f(3,k)$ to $f(4,k)$?" and so on. These are just the values in the bottom row, so see if you can find the pattern!
 
This will help you find out your *recursive definition* and you can use that to write your function!

## Writing the Function

Inside your `CQs` folder, create a file called `cq11_recursion.py`. Use that file to define `f`.

Your function should result in the following functionality:

<pre>
<div class="terminal">
>>> from CQs.cq11_recursion import f
>>> f(2,2)
4
>>> f(3,4)
12
>>> f(5,4)
20
</div>
</pre>
