# Questions

---

## General 
1. How do you create a test function? What identifies the function as a test? 
2. How do you create a file to write all your unit tests?  
3. What does the assert statement do?
4. Explain the difference between a use case and an edge case. Give an example of both within a function.

## Unit Test Writing

5. Suppose you have the following function, designed to return the index of the first even number in a list.

```python
def find_even(nums: list[int]) -> int:
    idx: int = 0
    while idx < len(nums):
        if nums[idx] % 2 == 0:
            return idx
        idx += 1
    return -1
```

Fill in this unit test with a use case.

```python
def test_find_even_use_case() -> None:
    """Put code here."""
```

---

6. Suppose you have the following function, designed to calculate the sum of the elements in a list.

```python
def sum_numbers(numbers: list[int]) -> int:
    if len(numbers) == 0: 
        raise Exception("Empty list - no elements to add")
    
    total: int = numbers[0]
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)): 
        total += numbers[i]
        
    return total
```

Fill in this unit test with a use case.

```python
def test_list_sum_use_case() -> None:
    """Put code here."""
```

---

7. Suppose you have the following function, designed to determine if a number is prime.

```python
def is_prime(n: int) -> bool:
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

Fill in this unit test with a use case.

```python
def test_is_prime_use_case() -> None:
    """Put code here."""
```

---

8. Suppose you want to test that a list of dictionaries will be mutated correctly. Here's a function that mutates a list of dictionaries by adding a new key-value pair to each dictionary in the list.

```python
def add_key_to_dicts(dicts: list[dict], key: str, value: int) -> None:
    for d in dicts:
        d[key] = value
```

Fill in this unit test with a use case to verify that the list of dictionaries is mutated correctly.

```python
def test_add_key_to_dicts_use_case() -> None:
    """Put code here."""
```

---

9. Suppose you want to test that a dictionary will be mutated correctly. Here's a function that mutates a dictionary by incrementing the value of a given key by 1.

```python
def increment_dict_value(d: dict[str, int], key: str) -> None:
    if key in d:
        d[key] += 1
    else:
        d[key] = 1
```

Fill in this unit test with a use case to verify that the dictionary is mutated correctly.

```python
def test_increment_dict_value_use_case() -> None:
    """Put code here."""
```

---

10. Suppose you have the following function, designed to sum the elements in a dictionary of list values and return the key with the largest summed value.

```python
def max_sum_dict(d: dict[str, list[int]]) -> str:
    keys = []
    for key in d:
        keys.append(key)

    values_list_1 = d[keys[0]]
    values_list_2 = d[keys[1]]

    total_1 = 0
    for value in values_list_1:
        total_1 += value

    total_2 = 0
    for value in values_list_2:
        total_2 += value

    if total_1 > total_2:
        return keys[0]
    else:
        return keys[1]
```

Fill in this unit test with a use case to verify that the function returns the key with the largest summed value.

```python
def test_max_sum_dict_use_case() -> None:
    """Put code here."""
```

# Solutions

## Conceptual Solutions

1. A test function is created just like any other Python function, but it is identified as a test by starting its name with `test_`. In frameworks like pytest, any function that starts with `test_` is automatically detected and run as a test.

2. Create a new Python file, often named `<module_name>_test.py`, in the same directory as your module. Write all your test functions in this file.

3. The assert statement checks if a condition is true. If the condition is false, an AssertionError is raised, indicating that the test has failed.

4. A use case is a typical scenario where the function is expected to work as intended. For example, in a function that sums a list, a use case would be passing a list like `[1, 2, 3]`.
An edge case is a situation where the function might struggle or behave differently, like passing an empty list `[]` to a sum function.


## Unit Test Writing

5. Solution below: 

```python
def test_find_even_use_case() -> None:
    nums = [1, 3, 5, 4, 7]
    assert find_even(nums) == 3
```

---

6. Solution below:

```python
def test_list_sum_use_case() -> None:
    # Test case 1: Normal list of positive numbers
    assert sum_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 15

    # Test case 2: List with negative numbers
    assert sum_numbers([-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]) == -15

    # Test case 3: Mixed positive and negative numbers
    assert sum_numbers([1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3]) == 0

    # Test case 4: List with a single element
    assert sum_numbers([10]) == 10

    # Do not worry about handling the exception! 
    # That is out of the scope of the class :)
```

7. Solution below:

```python
def test_is_prime_use_case() -> None:
    assert is_prime(7) is True
    assert is_prime(8) is False
```

8. Solution below:

```python
def test_add_key_to_dicts_use_case() -> None:
    dicts = [{"a": 1}, {"b": 2}]
    add_key_to_dicts(dicts, "c", 3)
    assert dicts == [{"a": 1, "c": 3}, {"b": 2, "c": 3}]
```

9. Solution below: 

```python
def test_increment_dict_value_use_case() -> None:
    d = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
    increment_dict_value(d, "a")
    assert d["a"] == 2
    increment_dict_value(d, "c")
    assert d["c"] == 1
```

10. Solution below: 

```python
def test_max_sum_dict_use_case() -> None:
    d = {"a": [1, 2, 3], "b": [4, 5]}
    assert max_sum_dict(d) == "b"
