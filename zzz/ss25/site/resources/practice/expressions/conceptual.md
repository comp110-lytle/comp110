# Solutions

## Conceptual Solutions

1. `20`, `int`
2. `"20232023"`, `str`
3. `<class 'float'>` (Or just `float` is sufficient on a quiz.)
4. `"44020"`
5. `4`
6. `4.0`
7. There are two possible answers:
    
    `"Saturday"[2] + "Saturday"[1] + "Saturday"[4]`

    or

    `"Saturday"[2] + "Saturday"[6] + "Saturday"[4]`

8. `bool`
9. `True`
