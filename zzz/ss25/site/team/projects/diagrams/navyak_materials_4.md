# Snippet

```python
def check_quiz(responses: list[bool]) -> int:
    answer_key: list[bool] = [True, True, False]
    correct: int = 0
    idx: int = 0
    while idx < len(responses):
        if responses[idx] == answer_key[idx]:
            correct += 1
            idx += 1
        else:
            idx += 1
    return correct

def main() -> None:
    my_quiz: list[bool] = [True, True, True]
    grade: int = check_quiz(my_quiz)
    print(f"{grade} out of 3 questions correct.")


main()
```

*Image Description

The Memory Diagram includes one box titled Output and below that box two columns, the left one titled Stack and the right one titled Heap.

The Stack includes 3 frames in the following order from top to bottom including Globals, main, and check_quiz.

The Globals frame has 2 variables including check_quiz and main.
- check_quiz points to a function on the Heap (lines 1-11).
- main points to a function on the Heap (lines 14-17).

The main frame has 4 items including the RA and RV, and variables named my_quiz and grade.
- The RA is defined at line 21.
- The RV is None.
- my_quiz points to a list[bool] on the Heap.
    - Indexes 0, 1, 2 and values True, True, True respectively.
- grade is 2.

The check_quiz frame has 6 items including the RA and RV, and variables named responses, answer_key, correct, and idx.
- The RA is defined at line 16.
- The RV is 2.
- responses points to the same list[bool] on the Heap as my_quiz.
- answer_key points to a new list[bool] on the Heap.
    - Indexes 0, 1, 2 and values True, True, False respectively.
- correct is 2.
    - Previous values of correct include 0 and 1, which are now crossed out.
- idx is 3.
    - Previous values of idx include 0, 1, and 2, which are now crossed out.

The Heap includes 2 function objects, and 2 list[bool] objects.

Output includes the phrase: “2 out of 3 questions correct.”
