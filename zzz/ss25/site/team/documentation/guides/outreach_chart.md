## What does outreach do?

The outreach team's primary goal is to support both the students and TAs such that both parties can focus on learning and teaching. Thus, we handle obstacles that come up for students, such as needing an extension or needing help figuring out how to study for the class. By helping students in difficult situations, we hope to take some burden off of the TAs.

## How can outreach help you?

If a student reaches out to you with an extenuating circumstance and needs an extension, send them the [extension request form](https://forms.gle/aNR6b7v9c9ZWSp9M7), and we will follow up with them!

If you interact with a student, either over email or in office hours/tutoring, that you feel could use some extra support or is in a situation you are not comfortable dealing with, fill out the [outreach form](https://forms.gle/EGehSWAMwhWJ71Yz5) and we will contact them!

## What happens when you submit an outreach form?

We assess the situation as a team and determine how we could support them. Usually this results in a one-on-one meeting where we discuss study strategies and how to best use the resources we offer.

Here's a flowchart to help decide when an email should result in contacting us:
