## Key Objectives

- Overview
- Managing the Different Google Sheets

## Overview

Running operations consists of keeping track of who’s missing office hours, who’s late to office hours, who missed submitting a shift lead report (which could mean they were absent), and team/student concerns.

It’s important to bring anything that seems like a problem to either Kris’ or Kaki’s attention. The information used to fill out the Google Sheet is collected from the automated Google Sheet that connects to the submitted shift lead reports. It is important to use `ShiftOverflow` as well to know who missed submitting a report.

### Daily Routine

When I have the time, I will check the shift lead report sheet throughout the day and message any shift lead that may have forgotten to submit a report while messaging another TA who worked the same hour to double check that the shift lead showed up.

On busy days with a full queue, I look at `course.care` to check who is calling tickets while comparing that to ShiftOverflow to double check the shift lead will submit an accurate report. By doing this, it is also possible to see if any shift leads may have been late but didn’t mark themselves as so, or didn’t make up the late time as they said they would, etc.

## Managing the Different Google Sheets

I use a google sheet that is shared with Kris and Kaki. There are a total of three sheets: **Numbers**, **Dates**, and **Team Concerns**. Below are screenshots without any specific names associated as examples. The sheets are not super pretty, but my main goal is **to make important information pop**! I use conditional formatting for the colors and alternating colors for the tables under `Format` in Google Sheets.

> Important Note: I do not count shift lead reports submitted more than 3 hours late. Submitting a report late means it could be inaccurate.

### Numbers Sheet

The Numbers sheet has a table to keep track of the number of absences, tardies, and missed shift lead reports a team member has. Each type has a point associated to it:

> - an absence is **1 point**

> - a tardy is **½ point**

> - a missed shift lead report is **1 point**

There is a column that keeps a total, and the cell will turn red once a team member has 4 or more points. Whenever I know either Kaki, Kris, or I have reached out to someone, there is another column that records the total of points of when they were last contacted. Lastly, I jot down reasons for absences and tardies, and anything else I come across that may be concerning.

> Ex: If I notice someone was absent from Office Hours, but the shift lead did not mark them as absent, I take note that the shift lead didn't mark that person as absent.

### Dates Sheet

The Dates sheet has tables with columns labeled by names. The rows of each column contain information of whether the person was late, absent, or missed a shift lead report, the hour of Office Hours it was for, and the date.

- (SL) is Missing Shift Lead Report
- (A) is absent
- (T) is tardy

### Team Concerns Sheet

The Team Concerns Sheet is a table that has 3 columns: Shift Lead, TA Comments and Concerns, and Dates. This means each row will have a name, the quote of the concern or comment, and the hour and date of the Office Hours shift.
