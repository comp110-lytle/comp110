## Primary Goals

- As an event planner for 110, your number one priority is to promote “joyful togetherness among the team” (`Kris Jordan`).

- Please do not overwhelm yourself with trying to make each and every event go perfectly. Do your best to help members feel welcomed and included – especially the new members – and encourage veteran members to stay with 110!

- Ultimately, don’t put too much pressure on yourself to bring everyone together. Just do your best and everything will surely work out. 

## Tips for Success

1) Do not feel like you’re alone in event planning. Feel free to bring along other team members to plan events and logistics together (like reserving rooms or equipment). If you’re ever looking for a new perspective to bounce ideas off of, chat with your coworkers during office hours! You can also speak with former event planners.

2) As you’re beginning your journey as event planner, brainstorm a list of ideas for the semester. Try to balance the old and the new. Hikes, game nights, PROM 110, and movie nights are good examples of traditional 110 events. The rest is up to you! Think outside the box and ask yourself (and others) what you’d want to happen during your first semester on the team – or even your last semester!

3) After brainstorming some ideas, make a tentative schedule of events. It’s so much easier to modify an event that you’ve already planned versus just winging it. This also helps to make sure that other group channels don’t schedule things at the same time as your events! Try to schedule something every two or three weeks, and keep in mind game days and breaks!

4) Inevitably, you will be put on the spot at team meetings, so be prepared! Know how to sell the events and have all details ready to be communicated. Sometimes, you will have to reach out to Kris to confirm the logistics of events – not the other way around. You and your team members are the captains of this ship, so go with your guts and take initiative! Be sure to call the organizations that you’ll be working with. Only after that, should you run plans by Kris. This will save a lot of time! 

## Logistics

- For certain events, you'll often need to reserve rooms or access computers. Make sure you talk to Kris about this! Sometimes, the computers require a professor or faculty login. Accessing the computers is especially important if you’re trying to do a movie night or something similar. 

- If you need any assistance covering costs (for things like pizza, sports equipment, etc.), be sure to communicate that info to Kris. The sooner costs can be communicated, the better! In general, there's not a great budget – so free + wholesome eventsç are ideal.

- It’s important to know how many people plan on coming to events. When posting info about your events on Slack, be sure to have people comment on a thread to show interest. That way, people receive notifications and are less likely to flake at the last minute. Trying to get people to react to your messages is good, too!
