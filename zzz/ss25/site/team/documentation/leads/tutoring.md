### Jack Coury

Graduation Year: 2026

Semesters on Team 110: 2

Major: Computer Science
Minor: Data Science

Why I <3 Team 110: Team 110 is the reason I continued my studies in computer programming. Having no prior coding experience and being an nontraditional student, Comp 110 was a challenge for me. The UTA's in Team 110 were encouraging, helpful, and welcoming, which helped me build the confidence and direction I needed to move foward. The collaborative and supportive environment in Team 110 is a worthy standard I hope to see students take out and uphold in the wider Computer Science field. 

Fun Fact: I initially went to school for violin performance, and still know my way around a fingerboard. 

Hobbies: My dog, cooking, cycling, and board games.
