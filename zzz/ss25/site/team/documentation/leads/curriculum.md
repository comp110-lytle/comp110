### Viktorya Hunanyan

Graduation Year: 2027

Semesters on Team 110: 1 Semester and 1 summer session

Why I <3 Team 110: I cannot express in words how much this family means to me. If anyone knows me, they know I can go on and on about my past schools and how much I hated them because of how competitive they were. Friendships were always transactional, and I always yearned to be part of a team. I literally commit everything to this team, and I am so lucky to work alongside these people, especially having Alyssa as a role model. 

Fun Fact: I will spiral into an oblivion knowing that I can't do everything and anthing all at once. I HATED CS before 110. Oh, also my screentime is on average 2 minutes :P.

## Responsibilities

NEW CONTENT WILL BE UP AND IN ORDER! 

Update, add, and fix quiz questions. Creating CQs and new exercise ideas, along with developing autograders for them. Making video solutions of CQs, quiz practice problems, and memory diagrams. Hosting review sessions. 


## Goals
QUIZ GRADES WILL GO UP

The same problem that has been used for the past three semesters and has appeared on BOTH a quiz AND the final exam will not have the worst score but the best score!

I want to introduce a new CQ format where students write a code solution and then draw a memory diagram based on their solution.


Push students a bit to be able to handle more on their CQs. This doesn't mean more challenging, but a bit more heavy on cenceptual details. 

Be able to push students to be able to explain their code, not merely read off what is happening, but understand why and how things are happening. This will help them start thinking computationally!
