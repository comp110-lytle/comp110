It’s tempting to immediately forget about the whole thing the second you finish
an interview, but if you can hang in there for a few minutes afterward there is
a benefit to doing some cleanup and tying of loose ends first. Below is more
information about how and why to do this.

## Interview Notes

This is a hard habit to get into, but it can be very beneficial. When putting an
interview on your schedule, leave an extra ~30 minutes afterward for unwinding
and reviewing the experience. Specifically, take note of these aspects of the
interview (to the extent that you can remember):

* High-level topics the interviewer covered
* Specific questions the interviewer asked
* Your answers to these questions
* What went well
* What didn’t go well
* Your impressions of the interviewer and any details about the company that came up (interviews are also a chance for you to get a sense of whether a company would be good for you and what you want)

This is a lot, but it’s worth it. Interviews are taxing, so it’s totally fine if you
don’t remember everything. But what you do remember, write down on a fresh
page in your recruiting notebook/binder/folder (bonus points for noting the
company, interviewer, role, and date).

The especially hard part is the “what didn’t go well” section — it’s not the
most exciting thing to relive the details of an interview you feel like you just
bombed, but the extra 30 minutes you give yourself are there for this purpose.
Even though it’s uncomfortable, if you use this time to be completely honest
with yourself about how things went and how you could’ve handled things better
when they didn’t go well, you will learn a lot from it.

Once you’ve done this hard part, you’re done! After all this reflection, let yourself
move on (this advice applies especially to interviews that don’t go so well —
you worked hard, made it out alive, and learned from it, which means it was
a success). Treat yourself to something that makes you happy and take a real
break, even if it’s short — no matter how the interview went, you deserve it.

## Purpose

As mentioned above, you can learn a lot from every interview, whether it went
well or not so well. Forcing yourself to focus on how it went immediately after
the fact is good since the longer you wait the more you forget, and its additional
benefits are two-fold: you can be more confident about what went well and things
you had fun with in the interview, and you can give yourself some constructive
feedback into what should get more focus next time you practice. Also, knocking
that out while it’s still fresh in your mind means you don’t have to drag it out
or dwell on it any more!

The other nice thing about writing all this down and keeping it in one place
is that you’ll build up a record of the processes you go through. You’re giving
your future self more resources and personalized feedback to review the next
time you have an interview coming up. It’s an extra nice bonus if you happen to
interview with the same company again later, since you’ll be able to look back
on what their specific process is like. It’s also cool to see all the work you put in
and how you change and improve over time!
