Recruiting is a lot easier to manage if you have clear goals and steps for achieving
them. This is true even if you don’t have a specific dream job in mind. Taking
one step at a time, the more opportunities you try for, the more natural it’ll
feel and the more you’ll understand what you’re looking for. This document
contains strategies and tips which might help accomplish that.

## Staying Organized

Keep a designated folder, binder, or notebook dedicated specifically to recruiting.
Good things to keep inside it include:

*  A few copies of your resume so that you can have it as a reference before
or during a phone or video interview.
*  Blank paper for jotting down important details recruiters may mention
during phone calls (often a phone screen or call when they extend an offer)
*  Notes from all the interviews you do (see the ‘After the Interview’ document
for more tips about this)

## Getting on a Schedule

Often, things get extra stressful when they feel like a big deal. With recruiting,
just like anything else, breaking it down into smaller chunks and doing little bits
on a consistent basis will help you accomplish more in a less intimidating manor.

Don’t wait till you have an interview scheduled to start preparing. That’s not
the time you want to give yourself even more pressure. Instead, a good approach
is to set yourself small goals like doing 3 practice coding challenges per week.
There may be more specific ways to prep for different kinds of opportunities,
and it’s okay to change your practice goals as your direction changes.

Another big thing is that consistency is key. Trying to set aside the same time
slot each week (even if it’s short), will help recruiting feel more routine and
habitual, and soon it’ll become something you’re so used to doing that it won’t
feel like such a stressful big deal. There’s less pressure when you spread it out
and doing so will help build a lasting foundation for the skills you’re practicing.

## Having fun?

It’s a stretch to say recruiting is at all fun. But it doesn’t have to be the
worst thing ever, either. Online resources for coding practice (see the ‘Technical
Practice’ section of the website) try to make it less mundane, and practicing
can be a group effort. It may not be the most exciting idea to get other people
involved in your recruiting world, but it can be nice to have a support system to
hold each other accountable and do mock interviews with (it’s awkward, but so
are real interviews and it’s good practice for behavioral stuff which is harder to
do alone anyway).
