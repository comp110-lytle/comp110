In an interview, keeping the following guidelines in mind will hopefully help
make it less stressful.

## Relax and have fun with it

You get to talk about the things you do, what you find exciting, and your
interests, and you maybe even get to think about challenging technical
problems too — it’s okay to let your personality show in the interview!

## Stay confident

You got the interview because the company thinks you might be a good fit
with them. They’re rooting for you and on your side. Plus, even though
technical questions can be intimidating, by working office hours as a TA
you’ve got lots of experience working through hard problems with people!

## Keep talking

Do all your thinking out loud. It’s not always about finding an answer
to a technical question, but what is always important is how you think.
Talk about the decisions you make, test cases you come up with, tricky
edge cases or problems you can identify along the way, what’s stopping
you where you get stuck, changes or improvements you’d make if you had
more time to be more methodical. . . really anything going through your
head that’s relevant.

## Be honest

### about your experiences

There’s a differene between embellishing what you’ve done to make it
sound fancy and making stuff up or taking credit for things you never
did. Be careful of that since you don’t want to get yourself into a
bind if it comes up in more detail later, and since the experiences you
do have are valuable on their own. On that note, don’t sell yourself
short! You’ve accomplished and learned a lot, and recruiting is a
great time to acknowledge that!

### about what you know and don’t know

Interviewers are there to help you. If they ask something you’re
unfamiliar with, it’s okay to acknowledge that, and good to follow
that up by mentioning that even though you don’t know it yet, you’re
interested in learning it, or maybe whether it’ll come up later on in
courses you’re taking. If you think you’re partially there with what
you know, you can talk about the stuff you do know that’s related
and explain any connections you try to make from there. Trying to
pretend you know something you don’t can backfire — you might get
asked more detailed questions about it since you claimed to know
the topic, and it’s likely the interviewer will be able to tell if you’re
making stuff up. The other benefit to being honest is that they may
even explain things to you or give you different questions based on
what you actually do know.

## Ask questions

### during technical or coding questions

Asking clarifying questions is always a good thing. It gives you a
better idea of what’s going on, resolves ambiguity in the problem so
that you don’t go in the wrong direction, and shows that you are
thoughtful and know how to recognize potential challenges.

### when the interviewer asks if you have any questions for them

Asking your interviewer questions shows you’re interested in the
company or role and gives you insight into what it’s really like, more
than what it says on their website. On that note, do some research
about the company beforehand — you don’t want to ask something
that is already clearly answered online somewhere, and you might
also find things you actually want to know more about. It’s good to
have one or two go-to questions ready, but also good to ask questions
you’re genuinely curious about or about things that are important to
you. This is your chance to get the inside scoop on what it’s like to
work there!

## Listen to the interviewer

### while working on technical questions

If your interviewer makes comments, asks questions, or chimes in
while you’re working on a technical question, chances are good that
they’re trying to steer you in the right direction. It’s always good to
listen to them and ask follow-up questions (or your own clarifying
questions in general) while you’re working. Not all interviewers will
be able to help you to the same degree, but they usually don’t say
things to try to throw you off track.

### in general during the interview

An interview is a chance for you to get a feel for the company too
and see if they’d be a good fit for you. You’ll know if things feel
super uncomfortable or if the interviewer is rude or unprofessional.
It’s hard to judge a whole company based off one interview, but it
can definitely be part of your overall analysis or impression of the
company. If things feel off to you, trust that and keep it mind as you
deal with the company in the future. This goes both ways, so it can
also turn out that they’re really great and that you get even more
excited about the company as a result of the interview.
