### What is Career110?

Welcome to Career110! This website is the home of career-related resources for Team110ers. The goal of this project is to create a go-to place for anything that might be useful for navigating the world of recruiting and careers. This relies on the input of the UTAs, so a huge thank you to those who have already contributed! If you'd like to contribute in any way, you can do so through the Input section of this website. That's also where you can leave any feedback you may have.

You can find information about different companies and people's experiences in the Airtable section, and the Resources section will contain reference guides and can also point you in the direction of other useful resources.

A main focus of the Team is creating a welcoming, supportive, and open community among UTAs. Hopefully, this resource will help contribute to that goal and provide a way for people to work together to make the subject of careers less intimidating and more manageable. Although it can sometimes be a lot, figuring out where you want to go in your career is exciting, and we're here to help make it happen!
