## Overview

We're using Airtable for the data side of this project. Our Airtable is focusing on providing a way for people to share their experiences with different companies, institutions, interactions, and opportunities, all in one place. We're a pretty big team, which means we've collectively got a lot of advice that can be helpful to everyone when navigating the decisions that come with acareer.

## Data

The Airtable contains information (such as location, size, and sector) about companies and institutions people have interacted with, different areas of focus for the kind of work and job types, details on interview experiences, advice, and other related information.

## Goal

This resource is also a way to spread the word about opportunities in different sectors and non-traditional experiences. It's important to be informed about all the different options when making choices about the companies you want to work for, the type of work you want to do, and what's really important to you.

If you find this helpful or if you're interested in supporting your fellow UTAs as they go through this process please add your own experiences to the Airtable! There's something to be learned from all experiences, even the ones that don't work out, so all input is welcome and appreciated.
